Randomness: Timed Pendulum Swings


The data used in this project represents the number of swings of a simple pendulum, manually recorded over 150 trials. The pendulum consisted of a meter-long string with a washer tied to the end, and the swings were measured by timing the pendulum's motion for randomly chosen durations between 10 and 20 seconds. This data was collected through a hands-on process to simulate an analog form of randomness, reflecting the natural variability of the pendulum's motion. The recorded values were then organized into a CSV file, formatted with two columns: "Time_Engaged_Seconds" and "Swings," to ensure compatibility with digital tools like p5.js. This approach is fascinating because its kind of like using a “physical algorithm” to produce randomness, meaning instead of using code I am relying on the physical properties of the real world to “find” numbers.
